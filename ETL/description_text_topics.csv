Practitioners working in the field of business analysis apply a wide range of modelling tools to capture the various perspectives of the enterprise, for example, business process perspective, data flow perspective, functional perspective, static structure perspective, and more. These tools aid in decision support and are especially useful in the effort towards the transformation of a business into the ""intelligent enterprise"", in other words, one which is to some extent ""self-describing"" and able to adapt to organisational change. However, a fundamental piece remains missing from the puzzle. Achieving this capability requires us to think beyond the idea of simply using the current mainstream modelling tools. Instead, we need to take into account methods that provide a basis for sharing meaning at both human and computational level, and that are geared to capturing the semantics (i.e. the meaning) of entities that describe our enterprise perspectives. This is where the concept of ontologies come in. Ontologies are representations that provide a basis for sharing meaning at human and computational level, and are an invaluable addition to any business analyst's toolkit. Show more"

The courses were too focused on the mechanics of Excel, on the commands and menu paths. And they used contrived, artificial examples. Improve your grades in business classes. Be better prepared for interviews. So I designed this course around authentic case studies from my experience as a senior business executive. The first case study is based on sales reporting and analysis. Students are given all of the sales information for a small company for an entire year. Through applying Excel functions like VLOOKUP and IF, the data is prepared for analysis. Then using pivot tables, the data is summarized and analyzed. The results are displayed visually with charts.

Often, both pre-analysis and post-analysis visualizations can help one understand “what is going on in the data"" in a way that looking at numerical summaries of fitted model estimates cannot. The lattice package in R is uniquely designed to graphically depict relationships in multivariate data sets. This course describes and demonstrates this creative approach for constructing and drawing grid-based multivariate graphic plots and figures using R. Lattice graphics are characterized as multi-variable (3, 4, 5 or more variables) plots that use conditioning and paneling. Consequently, it is a popular approach for, and a good fit to visually present the results of multi-variable statistical model fitting. The appearance of most of the plots, graphs and figures are determined by panel functions, rather than by the high-level graphics function calls themselves. Further, the user of lattice graphics has extensive and comprehensive control over many more of the details and features of the visual plots, far greater control that is afforded by the base graphics approach in R.

Though market analysis is an appropriate activity for both for-profit and not-for-profit enterprise, market analysis alone may not fully connect with the mission-mindedness of the not-for-profit organization. Community analysis can support knowledge of the community, its structures, and market opportunities, but the service mission of not-for-profits often focus more on service gaps, collaborations, and community impact in areas where for-profit entities do not perceive a market. For that reason, a community analysis may be more appropriate when the motivations are social good as primary and profit as secondary. Secondary, but still important profit motive can be translated into sustainability for the social good you are performing through the business. This training operationalizes mission-driven community analysis in a way that illuminates vision, translates it into actionable goals, organizes groups for collective action, and evaluated both process and impact.

Predictive analytics uses many techniques from data mining, statistics, modelling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to analyse current data to make predictions about future. One class of Predictive Analytics is to make prediction on Time Series Data. Studying historical data, collected over a period of time, can help in building models using which future can be predicted. For example, from historical data on Temperatures in a City, we can make decent predictions of what the Temperature could be in a future date. Or for that matter, from data collected over a reasonably long period of time regarding various life style aspects of a Diabetic patient, we can predict what should be the volume of Insulin to inject on a given date in future. One example to consider from the Business world could be to predict the Volume of In-Roamers in a Telecom Network in any given period of time in the future from the historical details of In-Roamers in the Network.

Этот навык нужен во многих профессиях - программистам, тестировщикам, администраторам баз данных, аналитикам, data scientist'ам и многим другим.  Объём данных в мире растёт экспоненциальными темпами. И многие из этих данных по-прежнему реляционные - состоят из таблиц, строк и колонок.

Se trata de  una enfermedad infecciosa causada por el virus SARS-CoV-2.9 Se detectó por primera vez en la ciudad china de Wuhan (provincia de Hubei), en diciembre de 2019. Habiendo llegado a más de 100 territorios, el 11 de marzo de 2020 la Organización Mundial de la Salud la declaró pandemia. Produce síntomas similares a los de la gripe, entre los que se incluyen fiebre, tos seca, disnea, mialgia y fatiga. En casos graves se caracteriza por producir neumonía, síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda, sepsis y choque séptico que conduce a alrededor del 3 % de los infectados a la muerte. No existe tratamiento específico; las medidas terapéuticas principales consisten en aliviar los síntomas y mantener las funciones vitales. Y precisamente por eso es importante saber adelantarnos a sus graves consecuencias, y nuestra forma es a través del análisis de datos. Cientos de países están confinados, con la gente sin poder salir de sus casa y con unas medidas de precaución extremas, preguntándose cuándo podrán recuperar la normalidad, por qué hemos acabado en esta situación, si se podría haber prevenido o si hay algo en nuestras manos además de esperar. La idea es enseñaros a leer varias fuentes de datos, saber ver cuando esos datos son correctos y cuando no, a prepararlos para su visualización, su clasificación y su correcto análisis, desde el punto de vista geográfico, de series de tiempo y de modelos matemáticos como el famoso SIR.

Serve para que você possa dar suas pinceladas e criar suas pinturas iniciais. Essa é a ideia deste curso: abrir o caminho para o mundo dos dados e ajudar você a compreender e criar melhores análises. O nome Data Science ou Ciência de Dados está na moda. É o conjunto de técnicas que ajudam você a extrair conhecimentos a partir de um grande conjunto de dados. Parece algo super técnico e complexo, possível de ser feito apenas por grandes matemáticos e estatísticos. É técnico e é complexo, mas todo mundo começa de algum lugar, certo? Esse é o objetivo deste curso: introduzir você à Ciência dos Dados e mostrar que, mesmo com algumas ferramentas básicas, é possível descobrir muita coisa interessante na sua organização ou em sua pesquisa. Hoje em dia, com o grande volume de dados disponível, não basta apenas ter uma formação em Matemática ou Estatística. É necessário conhecer ferramentas de tecnologia que consigam processar este monte de números e textos. Do mesmo modo, nada disso é realmente útil se você não tiver conhecimento sobre o negócio e não souber quais as perguntas corretas a fazer. Já vi muitos estudos que respondem perguntas que não interessam ou que trazem respostas que não levam em consideração aspectos importantes do cenário. Show more"
